            This feeling in my heart was temporarily suppressed.Because I know I have to be better to see you again.</span><br/>
			<span class="comments">......</span><br/>
			<span class="comments">After three years of waiting, I thought I could finally accompany you.Yet fate has once again played a trick on us.
            I didn't want to miss you again.I had decided to expressed my heart to you even though I had to endure the pain of lovesickness again.</span><br/>

			<span class="comments">I never regret this decision. On the contrary, I'm glad I kept you.Thank you for giving me the chance to love you.

			<span class="comments">......</span><br/>
			<span class="comments">The longer the lovesickness, the stronger the desire to see you.</span><br/>
